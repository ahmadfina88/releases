DigiralRs Raspberry Pi Daemon built on model 2 and 3 </br>

Howto Build on Pi
================
Just follow the same instructions defined in build-unix.txt </br>
apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libdb++-dev libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev libminiupnpc-dev </br>
Finally strip digitalrsd and copy in binary path. </br>
</br>
Note: There is a huge build time difference between Pi2 and Pi3 because Pi3 has 1.2 Ghz Quad cores compared </br>
to 900Mhz on Pi2. Not only that, they have a generation differnce which makes Pi3 faster and slighlty more power </br>
hungry consuming 2.5 Amps. </br>
